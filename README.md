## Which statistical analysis should I use?
## Statistical analyses using R

### Notes

This page is based (heavily) on [UCLA IDRE](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/)'s excellent [What statistical analysis should I use?](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/whatstat/default.htm) content, which is itself an extension of Leeper's [Choosing the Correct Statistic](http://bama.ua.edu/~jleeper/627/choosestat.html). UCLA presents thorough examples for SAS, Stata, and SPSS. The goal here is to provide equivalent examples in R.
